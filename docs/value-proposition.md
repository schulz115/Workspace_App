## The problem

There are many note-taking apps that are either not available on all devices and platforms or do not offer any collaborative functions. We want to solve this problem with our app.
## Our solution

Our app is web-based and can therefore be used on any device and in any browser. It offers collaborative function, such as joint editing of notes, to provide the most pleasant user experience possible.
## Target user

Our target group includes all people who are looking for a note app to work together on notes and at the same time are looking for an app that is available on all platforms.
## Customer journey

To create the diagram, we previously used https://mermaid.live/, as this offers a live view.
