# Sources

In this section, we want to show the sources used. We would also show transparently where we have used LLMs.

## Overwiew and usage of LLM
First of all, we would like to give you an overview of the files in which we have used LLMs. 
We would also like to mention what we have used the LLM for in the files. 

Note: The smallest use of LLM results in the file being counted towards the use of LLM.

2nd note: Due to the fact that the GitHub Copilot is also based on ChatGPT 4o, these are specified together as the same LLM.

### Overwiew of LLM
We used following LLMs:

+ ChatGPT 4o
+ ChatGPT 3o
+ DeepL (sometimes used for translation)

### LLM for documentation

| File | Prompt |

| **sources.md** | We had considered implementing Mermaid for visualization purposes. We asked ChatGPT how the implementation works. ChatGPT gave us an example, which we implemented based on our flow. This did not work after several attempts, which is why we removed Mermaid. |

### Internet sources

### Sources for documentation
The majority of the documentation sources are based on the template. The structures and functions were predefined. We used these as the basis for creating the documentation. We have already mentioned the use of LLMs for documentation above.
