# Sources

In this section, we want to show the sources used. We would also show transparently where we have used LLMs.

## Overwiew and usage of LLM
First of all, we would like to give you an overview of the files in which we have used LLMs. 
We would also like to mention what we have used the LLM for in the files. 

Note: The smallest use of LLM results in the file being counted towards the use of LLM.

2nd note: Due to the fact that the GitHub Copilot is also based on ChatGPT 4o, these are specified together as the same LLM.

### Overwiew of LLM
We used following LLMs:

+ GPT-4o
+ GPT-3o-mini-high
+ DeepL (sometimes used for translation)

We used the structure diagram of the course as a basis for our project. We used this as a template to create the basic structure of our app as we have created the layout of the local project and its directory. YouTube guides and other documentations were used as templates for the files. 

We used LLMs in almost every file. The process was as follows: As a rule, we first searched the Internet for code examples and adapted them to our needs with the help of GPT-4o. We also used GPT-4o for all the troubleshooting. The internet sources we used are also listed. From this point on, LLMs were used in every file in order to adapt the templates for our specific project needs. It should be clarified and in no way trivialised that chatbots served as an integral piece in the creation of the project. We are fully aware of the implications and also of the fact that this results in a direct decrease in personal contribution.

### LLM for documentation

| File | Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| **sources.md** | We had considered implementing Mermaid for visualization purposes. We asked GPT-4o how the implementation works. ChatGPT gave us an example, which we implemented based on our flow. This did not work after several attempts, which is why we removed Mermaid. |

### Sources for documentation
The majority of the documentation sources are based on the template. The structures and functions were predefined. We used these as the basis for creating the documentation. We have already mentioned the use of LLMs for documentation above.
